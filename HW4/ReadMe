Contributions

A. DeAbreu, J. Williams and C. Burke contributed equal parts to this assignment. the lab portion labled "Sampling"
in the notebook was completed separately by the three of us. Note: this assignment is incomplete. we did the best 
we could with our knowlege and some help from the internet to complete this. we, collectively, just do not have a 
good enough background with python to figure out the code to complete these assignments
