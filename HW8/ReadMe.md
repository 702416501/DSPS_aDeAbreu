The figure above shows a plot of the measured, predicted, and residual sea level height in
Hilo, Hawaii in mid-November, 2006. Data was collected at [NOAA's National Ocean Service](https://www.weather.gov/hfo/Nov15tsunami)
tide gague near Hilo. The notebook made to create the plot can be found [here](https://github.com/702416501/DSPS_aDeAbreu/blob/master/HW8/HW8.ipynb) and the data that was used to create the plot can be found [here](https://github.com/702416501/DSPS_aDeAbreu/blob/master/HW8/Hw8data.txt). 


# FBB very good plot! 
I find the colors a bit overwhealming at this level of saturation. perhaps squtch and plot residuals in gray (black with low alpha) and a slightly lighter blue for the data to differentiate it better from the model?

also better use of y space : move the legend to the bottom right and crop the y axis closer to the data

Good tho!
