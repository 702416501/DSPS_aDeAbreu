## Improvements:

1. There is a considerable amount of white space at the top and at the bottom of the graph that can be reduced by adjusting the y limits of the graph. As well as the predicted curve doesn't have any data points, so it possible to reduce the x limit in a way that the graph finishes at the last peak to make the graph more symmetric

2. The x label units of the plot don't accurately represent the ticks of the x axis, since all ticks appear as MM-DD HH; since of the values show

3. It is confusing to determine what does the MLLW line represents, since it just appears to be the zero point of the scale of the measurement and I donâ€™t think the dash line is the best format to represent it because it distracts the attention on the other parts of the plot. 

## Quality: 

The graph does a very good job at showing how does the data correlate with the predicted model since the data points and the curve are very easy to tell apart and to see how they relate to one another.
